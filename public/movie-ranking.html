<h1>The Best Movies According to Myself</h1>
<h2>The Top Three Movies I Can Recall Right Now</h2>
<hr>
<h3>Once Upon a Time in Hollywood</h3>
<p>Really cool movie with a (somewhat predictable) twist at the end.<br>
Brad Pitt steals the show on this one.</p>
<h3>Drive</h3>
<p>Beautiful aesthetics and a moody soundtrack. Also, Ryan Gosling in a silent role.</p>
<h3>The Lord of the Rings Trilogy</h3>
<p>Couldn't pick just one. If you've watched it, you most certainly understand me.</p>
